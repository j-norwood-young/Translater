# Translater

A browser extension to translate text on any page.

*NOTE*: This extension is very alpha.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo and enter the project directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.js.git
    cd transformers.js/examples/extension/
    ```
1. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install 
    ```

3. Build the project:
    ```bash
    npm run build 
    ```

4. Add the extension to your browser. To do this, go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable developer mode (top right), and click "Load unpacked". Select the `build` directory from the dialog which appears and click "Select Folder".

5. That's it! You should now be able to open the extension's popup and use the model in your browser!
